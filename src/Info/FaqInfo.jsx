    qs: "What is a managed forex account?",
    ans: "A managed forex account is a type of currency trading account in which a professional money manager makes trades and transactions on a client's behalf for a fee.

Managed forex accounts offer exposure to an asset class much different than stocks or bonds. However, managed forex accounts are high-risk, high-reward investments",
